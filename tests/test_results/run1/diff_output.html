<del style="background:#ffe6e6;">My lords, i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I</ins><span>t is with very great diffidence that I rise to address you, both because I</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">'</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> ha</ins><span>ve only once before addressed your lord</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ships</del><span> house</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and because </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">after</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I'm am</ins><span> listening to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that other speakers have ten times the political knowledge and twenty times the experience that has fallen to my lo</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">t, a</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ve. A</ins><span>nd that it is an impertinence for me to say anything at all. At the same time, the subject to which I wish to confine my remarks, namely</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> the atomic bomb and its bearing on policy</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> is so important and w</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">eigh</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ay</ins><span>s so heavily upon my mind</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> that I feel almost bound to say something about what it means for the future of mankind. I should like to begin with just a few technical points, which I think are familiar to everybody. The first is that the atomic bomb is of course in its infancy</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and is quite certain very quickly to become both much more destructive and very much cheaper to produce. Both those points, I think we may take a certain</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. T</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> t</ins><span>hen there is another point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which was raised by Professor Ol</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">iph</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">af</ins><span>ant</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> and that is that it will not be very difficult to spray a countryside with radioactive products, which will kill every living thing throughout a wide area, not only human beings, but every insect, every sort of thing that lives. And there is a further point, which perhaps relates to the somewhat more distant future</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. A</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, a</ins><span>s your </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">L</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">l</ins><span>ordships know, there are</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> in theory</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> two ways of tapping nuclear</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> energy</del><span>. One is the way</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> which has now been made practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into nuclei of medium weight. The other is the way which has not yet been made practicable</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> but which I think will be in time</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>amely the synthesizing of hydrogen atoms to make heavier atoms, helium atoms</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> or perhaps in the first instance nitrogen atoms. I</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">n the course of that synthesis, i</del><span>f it can be affected, there will be </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">a </del><span>very much greater release of energy th</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">a</ins><span>n there is in the disintegration of uranium atoms. </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">At</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">The</ins><span> present</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> this process has never been observed</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> but it is held </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">tha</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">bu</ins><span>t it occurs in the sun and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in nature at temperatures comparable to those you get inside of the sun. The present atomic bomb in exploding </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">pro</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">re</ins><span>duces temperatures which are thought to be about those in the inside of the sun. It is therefore possible that some mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to set off this much more violent explosion which would be obtained if one could synthesize heavier elements</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> out of hydrogen</del><span>. All that must take place if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not bring itself to destruction</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> all that is bound to happen. We do not want to look at this thing simply from the point of view of the next few years</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, w</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. W</ins><span>e want to look at it from the point of view of the future</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> of mankind. The question is a simple one. Is it possible f</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. F</ins><span>or a scientific society</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> to continue to exist</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> or must such a society inevitably bring it</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">self to destruction</del><span>. It is a simple question, but</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> a very vital one</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">..</ins><span>. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the gravity of the possibilities of evil that lie in the utilization of atomic energy. A</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">nd I</ins><span> go about the streets and see </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">St.Pau</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">some poo</ins><span>ls, the British Museum, the </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">H</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">h</ins><span>ouses of Parliament</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and the other monuments of our civili</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">z</ins><span>ation</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. I</ins><span>n my mind</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s eye</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> I see a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of rubble</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> with corpses all round them. That is a thing we have got to face</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>ot only in our own count</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">r</ins><span>y and cities, but throughout the civilized world as a real probability</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war rare. Great and serious war has got to be abolished</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> because otherwise these things will happen. </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">To abo</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">Your bul</ins><span>lish war is</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> of course</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> a very difficult problem. I have no desire to find fault with those who are trying to tackle that problem. I am qui</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><span>t</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span> sure I could not do any</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> better</del><span>. I simply feel that this is a problem that man has got to solve</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> o</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. O</ins><span>therwise</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> man will drop out</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and the planet will perhaps be happ</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ier</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">y</ins><span> without us, although we cannot be expected to share that view. I think we have got to find a way of dealing with this. As everybody is aware, the immediate difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with Russia in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister achieved in Washington w</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">as</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ould</ins><span> probably as much as could at that time be achiev</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span>d. I do not suppose he could have done any better at that time. I am not one of those who favor the unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured. I think it is right that condition</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span> should be attached to that revelation.</span>
