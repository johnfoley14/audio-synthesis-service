 It is
 with very great diffidence that I rise to
 address you, both because I have only
 once before addressed your
 lordship's
 house, and because of listening to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that
 other speakers have ten times the
 political knowledge and twenty
 times the experience that is four.
 And that it is an impertinence for me to
 say anything at
 all. At the same time, the subject to which I wish
 to confine my remarks,
 namely the atomic
 bomb and its bearing on
 policy is so
 important and
 ways so heavily upon my mind that I feel all of bound to say
 something about what it means for the future of
 mankind.
 I should like to begin with just
 a few technical
 points, which I think are familiar to everybody.
 The first is
 that the atomic bomb is of course in its
 infancy and is quite
 certain very quickly to become both much more
 destructive and very much cheaper to produce.
 Both those
 points, I think we may take a certain
 little bit. Then there
 is another point which was raised by Professor Olafant and that is that it will not be very
 difficult to spray a countryside
 with radioactive
 products which will kill every living thing
 throughout a wide
 area, not only human
 beings but every insect, every sort of thing that lives.
 And there is a further
 point which perhaps relates to the somewhat
 more distant future.
 As your lordships know, there are in theory
 two ways of tapping nuclear energy.
 One is the
 way which has now been made practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into
 nuclei of medium weight.
 The other is
 the way which has not yet been
 made practicable but which I
 think will be
 in
 time. Namely, the synthesising of hydrogen atoms to make heavier
 atoms, helium atoms, or perhaps in the
 first instance nitrogen atoms. In the course of that synthesis, if it
 can be affected, there will be a very much
 greater release of energy than there is.
 The present, this process has never been observed, but it is held that it occurs in the
 sun and in the interior of other stars.
 It only occurs in nature at temperatures comparable to
 those you get inside of the sun.
 The present
 atomic
 bomb in exploding produces temperatures
 which are thought to be about
 those in the inside of the sun.
 It is therefore
 possible that some mechanism
 analogous to the present atomic bomb could
 be used to set off
 this much more violent explosion which would be
 obtained if one could
 synthesize heavier elements out of hydrogen.
 All that must
 take place. If our scientific
 civilization goes on, if it does not bring itself to destruction.
 We do not want
 to look at this thing simply from the point of
 view of the next few years. We
 want to look at it from the point of view of the
 future of mankind.
 For
 a scientific society to continue to
 exist or must such a society inevitably bring it.
 It is a simple question, but...
 I do not think it is possible to
 exaggerate the gravity of the
 possibilities of evil that lie in
 the utilisation of atomic energy.
 It's like all about the streets and
 seats
 in pools, the British Museum, the houses of
 parliament, and the other monuments of our
 civilization, in my mind's eye I see a nightmare vision of those
 buildings as heaps of
 rubble, with corpses all raised.
 That is a thing we have got to
 face, not only in our own
 country and cities, but throughout the
 civilized world, as a real probability, unless the world will agree to find a way
 It is not enough to make war rare.
 Great and
 serious war has got to be
 abolished because otherwise
 these things will happen.
 To
 a bullish war is of course a very difficult problem.
 I have no desire to find
 fault with those who are trying to tackle
 that problem. I am
 quite sure I could not do
 any better. I simply feel
 that this is a
 problem that man has got to
 solve.
 Otherwise man will drop
 out and the planet will perhaps be happy without us, or that we cannot be expected.
 As everybody is aware, the immediate difficulty is
 to find a way of cooperating with
 Russia, in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister
 achieved in
 Washington was probably as much as
 code at that time be achieved.
 I do not suppose he
 not one of those who favor the unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured.
 I think it is right that conditions
 should be attached to that revelation.
