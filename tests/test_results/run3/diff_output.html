<del style="background:#ffe6e6;">My lords, i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I</ins><span>t is with very great diffidence that I rise to address you, both because I</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">'</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> ha</ins><span>ve only once before addressed your lordship</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s house and because </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">after</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I'm</ins><span> listening to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that other speakers have </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ten</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">10</ins><span> times the political knowledge and </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">twenty</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">20</ins><span> times the experience that has fallen to my lot</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> and that it is an impertinence for me to say anything at all. At the same time, the subject to which I wish to confine my remarks, namely the atomic bomb and its b</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ear</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">urn</ins><span>ing on policy</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> is so important and w</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">eighs</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ay</ins><span> so heavily upon my mind</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> that I feel almost bound to say something about what it means for the future of mankind. I should like to begin with just a few technical points, which I think are familiar to everybody. The first is that the atomic bomb is of course in its infancy and is quite certain very quickly to become both much more destructive and very much cheaper to produce. Both those points</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> I think we may take a certain</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. T</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> t</ins><span>hen there is another point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which was raised by Professor Ol</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">iph</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">af</ins><span>ant</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> and that is that it will not be very difficult to spray a countryside with radioactive products</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which will kill every living thing throughout a wide area, not only human beings</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> but every insect, every sort of thing that lives. And there is a further point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which perhaps relates to the somewhat more distant future. As your </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">L</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">l</ins><span>ordships know, there are in theory two ways of tapping nuclear energy. One is the way which has now been made practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into nuclei of medium weight. The other is the way which has not yet been made practicable but which I think will be in time</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>amely the synthesi</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">z</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span>ing of hydrogen atoms to make heavier atoms, helium atoms</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> or perhaps in the first instance</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> nitrogen atoms. In the course of that synthesis, i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. Night. I</ins><span>f it can be affected, there will be a very much greater release of energy th</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">a</ins><span>n there is in the disintegration of uranium atoms. At present</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> this process has never been observed</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> but it is held that it occurs in the sun and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in nature at temperatures comparable to those you get inside of the sun. The present atomic bomb in exploding produces temperatures which are thought to be about those in the inside of the sun. It is therefore possible that some mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to set off this much more violent explosion which would be obtained if one </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">c</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">w</ins><span>ould synthesize heavier elements</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> out of hydrogen</del><span>. All that must take place if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not bring itself to destruction</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> all that is bound to happen. We do not want to look at this thing simply from the point of view of the next few years</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> we want to look at it from the point of view of the future of mankind. </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">The question is a simple one. Is it possible f</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">F</ins><span>or a scientific society to continue to exist</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> or must such a society inevitably bring it</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">self to destruction</del><span>. It is a simple question, but</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> a very vital one</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">..</ins><span>. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the gravity of the possibilities of evil that lie in the utilization of atomic energy. A</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">nd I</ins><span> go about the streets and see </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">St.Pau</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">some poo</ins><span>ls, the British Museum, the </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">H</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">h</ins><span>ouses of Parliament</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and the other monuments of our civili</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">z</ins><span>ation</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. I</ins><span>n my mind</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s eye</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> I see a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of rubble</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> with corpses all round them. That is a thing we have got to face</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>ot only in our own count</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">r</ins><span>y and cities, but throughout the civilized world as a real probability</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">I</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">i</ins><span>t is not enough to make war rare. Great and serious war has got to be abolished</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> because otherwise these things will happen. </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">To abo</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">Your bul</ins><span>lish war is of course a very difficult problem. I have no desire to find fault with those who are trying to tackle that problem. I am qui</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><span>t</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span> sure I could not do any better. I simply feel that this is a problem that man has got to solve</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> o</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. O</ins><span>therwise</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> man will drop out</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and the planet will perhaps be happ</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ier</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">y</ins><span> without us, although we cannot be expected to share that view. I think we have got to find a way of dealing with this. As everybody is aware, the immediate difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with Russia in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as co</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ul</del><span>d</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span> at that time be achiev</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span>d. I do not suppose he could have done any better at that time. I am not one of those who favor the unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> it.</ins><span> I think it is right that condition</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span> should be attac</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">h</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">k</ins><span>ed</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> to that revelation</del><span>.</span>
