<span>My </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">l</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">L</ins><span>ords, it is with very great diffidence </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>that I rise to address </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>you, both because I</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">'</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> ha</ins><span>ve only once before addressed your </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">l</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">L</ins><span>ordship</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>house</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and because </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">after</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">of the</ins><span> listening to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that other speakers have ten times the political knowledge and twenty times the experience that has fallen to my lot</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, a</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. A</ins><span>nd that it is an impertinence for me to say anything at all. At the same time, the subject to which I wish to confine my remarks, namely the atomic bomb and </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>it</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s bearing on policy, is so important and weighs so heavily upon my mind</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> that I feel al</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">most</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ways  of</ins><span> bound to say something about what it means for the future of mankind. I should like to begin with just a few technical points</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which I think are familiar to everybody. The first is that the atomic bomb is of course in its infancy and is quite certain very quickly to become both much more destructive and very much cheaper to produce. Both those points</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> I think we may take a certain</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. T</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> t</ins><span>hen there is another point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which was raised by Professor Oliphant</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> and that is that it will not be very difficult to spray a countryside with radioactive products</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which will kill every living thing throughout a wide area, not only human beings</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> but every insect, every sort of thing that lives</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. A</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> a</ins><span>nd the</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">re is a</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">n to</ins><span> further point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which perhaps relates to the somewhat more distant future. As your </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">L</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">l</ins><span>ordships know</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> there are in theory two ways of tapping nuclear energy.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> One is the way which has now been made </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into nuclei of medium </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>weight. The other is the way which has not yet been made </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>practicable but which I think will be in </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>time. Namely the synthesizing of hydrogen atoms to make heavier atoms</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> helium atoms or perhaps in the first instance nitrogen atoms. In the course of that synthesis</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> if it can be affected</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> there will be a very much greater release of energy th</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">a</ins><span>n there is in the disintegration</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> of uranium atoms</del><span>. A</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">t</del><span> present this process has never been observed but it is held that it occurs in the sun and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in nature at temperatures comparable to those you get inside of the sun. The present atomic bomb in exploding produces temperatures which are thought to be about those in the inside of the sun. It is therefore possible that some mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to set off this much more violent explosion which would be obtained if one could synthesize heavier elements out of hydrogen. All that must take place if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not bring itself to destruction all that is bound to happen. We do not want to look at this thing simply from the point of view of the next few years</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> we want to look at it from the point of view of the future of mankind. The question is a simple one. Is it possible for a scientific society to continue to exist or must such a society inevitably bring itself to destruction</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">.</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">?</ins><span> It is a simple question</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> but a very vital one. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the gravity of the possibilities of evil that lie in the utilization of atomic energy. As </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I</ins><span> go about the streets and see St</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">.</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>Paul</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s, the British Museum, the Houses of Parliament and the other monuments of our civili</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">z</ins><span>ation</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. I</ins><span>n my mind</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s eye I see a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of rubble with corpses all round them. That is a thing we have got to face</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> n</ins><span>ot only in our own count</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">r</ins><span>y and cities</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> but throughout the civilized world as a real probability unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war rare. Great and serious war has got to be abolished because otherwise these things will happen. To abolish war is of course a very difficult problem. I have no desire to find fault with those who are trying to tackle that problem. I am qui</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><span>t</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span> sure I could not do any better. I simply feel that this is a problem that man has got to solve otherwise man will drop out</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> a</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. A</ins><span>nd the planet will perhaps be happier without us</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> although we cannot be expected to share that view. I think we have got to find a way of dealing with this</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. A</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> a</ins><span>s everybody is aware</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> the immediate difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with Russia in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as could at that time be achiev</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span>d. I do not suppose he could have done any better at that time. I am not one of those who favor the unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured. I think it is right that condition</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span> should be attached to that</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> revelation</del><span>.</span>
