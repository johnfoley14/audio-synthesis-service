In the course of that synthesis if it can be affected there will be a very much greater release of energy than there is in the disintegration. A present this process has never been observed but it is held that it occurs in the sun and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in nature at temperatures comparable to those you get inside of the sun. The present atomic bomb in exploding produces temperatures which are thought to be about those in the inside of the sun. It is therefore possible that some mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to set off this much more violent explosion which would be obtained if one could synthesize heavier elements out of hydrogen. All that must take place if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not bring itself to destruction all that is bound to happen. We do not want to look at this thing simply from the point of view of the next few years we want to look at it from the point of view of the future of mankind. The question is a simple one. Is it possible for a scientific society to continue to exist or must such a society inevitably bring itself to destruction? It is a simple question but a very vital one. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the gravity of the possibilities of evil that lie in the utilization of atomic energy. As I go about the streets and see St Paul's, the British Museum, the Houses of Parliament and the other monuments of our civilization. In my mind's eye I see a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of rubble with corpses all round them. That is a thing we have got to face not only in our own country and cities but throughout the civilized world as a real probability unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war rare. Great and serious war has got to be abolished because otherwise these things will happen. To abolish war is of course a very difficult problem. I have no desire to find fault with those who are trying to tackle that problem. I am quite sure I could not do any better. I simply feel that this is a problem that man has got to solve otherwise man will drop out. And the planet will perhaps be happier without us although we cannot be expected to share that view. I think we have got to find a way of dealing with this as everybody is aware the immediate difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with Russia in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as could at that time be achieved. I do not suppose he could have done any better at that time. I am not one of those who favor the unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured. I think it is right that conditions should be attached to that.": 31026.013916015625
