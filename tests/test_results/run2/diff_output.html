<span>My lord</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s</del><span>, it is with very great diffidence that I rise to address you, both because I've only once before addressed your lord</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>ship</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s house</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and because </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">after</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I'm</ins><span> listening to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that other speakers have ten times the political knowledge and twenty times the experience</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> that has fallen to my lot, a</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. A</ins><span>nd that it is an impertinence for me to say anything at all</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. A</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, a</ins><span>t the same time, the subject to which I wish to confine my remarks, namely</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> the atomic bomb and its bearing on policy</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> is so important and w</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">eigh</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ay</ins><span>s so heavily upon my mind</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> that I feel almost bound to say something about what it means for the future of mankind. I should like to begin with just a few technical points, which I think are familiar to everybody. The first is that the atomic bomb is of course in its infancy and is quite certain very quickly to become both much more destructive and very much cheaper to produce. Both those points, I think we may take a certain</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> little bit</ins><span>. Then there </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">wa</ins><span>s another point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which was raised by Professor Ol</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">iph</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">af</ins><span>ant</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> and that is that it will not be very difficult to spray a countryside with radioactive products</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which will kill every living thing throughout a wide area</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> not only human beings</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> but every insect, every sort of thing that lives.</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> And</del><span> there is a further point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which perhaps relates to the somewhat more distant future</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. A</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> a</ins><span>s your </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">L</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">l</ins><span>ordships know, there are in theory two ways of tapping nuclear energy. One is the way which has now been made practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into nuclei of medium weight. The other is the way which has not yet been made practicable</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> but which I think will be in time</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>amely the synthesizing of hydrogen atoms to make heavier atoms, helium atoms</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> or perhaps in the first instance nitrogen atoms. In the course of that synthesis, if it can be affected, there will be a very much greater release of energy th</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">a</ins><span>n there is in the disintegration of uranium atoms. At present</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> this process has never been observed</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> but it is held that it occurs in the sun and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in nature at temperatures comparable to those you get inside of the sun. The present atomic bomb in exploding produces temperatures which are thought to be about those in the inside of the sun. It is therefore possible that s</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ome</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">un</ins><span> mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to set off this much more violent explosion which would be obtained if one could synthesize heavier elements out of hydrogen. All that must take place</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not bring itself to destruction</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> all that is bound to happen. We do not want to look at this thing simply from the point of view of the next few years</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, w</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. W</ins><span>e want to look at it from the point of view of the future of mankind. The question is a simple one. Is it possible for a scientific society to continue to exist</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> o</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">? O</ins><span>r must such a society inevitably bring its</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">elf to destruction</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">..</ins><span>. It is a simple question, but</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> a very vital one. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">...</ins><span> the gravity of the possibilities of evil that lie in the utilization of atomic energy. As </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I</ins><span> go about the streets and </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">see St.Pauls,</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">cease and pause</ins><span> the British </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">M</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">m</ins><span>useum, the </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">H</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">h</ins><span>ouses of </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">P</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">p</ins><span>arliament and the other monuments of our civilisation</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. I</ins><span>n my mind</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s eye I see a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of rubble with co</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">rpses all round them. That is a thing w</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ke. W</ins><span>e have got to face</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>ot only in our own count</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">r</ins><span>y and cities, but throughout the civilized world as a real probability</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war rare. Great and serious war has got to be abolished because otherwise these things will happen. </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">To</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">Your</ins><span> abolish war is</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> of course</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> a very difficult problem. I have no desire to find fault with those who are trying to tackle that problem. I am qui</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><span>t</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span> sure</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> I could not do any better. I simply feel that t</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. T</ins><span>his is a problem that man has got to solve</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> o</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. O</ins><span>therwise</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> man will drop out and the planet will perhaps be happ</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ier</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">y</ins><span> without us, although we cannot be expected to share that view. I think we have got to find a way of dealing with this. As everybody is aware, the immediate difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with Russia in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as co</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ul</del><span>d</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span> at that time be achiev</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span>d. I do not suppose he could have done any better </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">than the Prime Minister. Minister </ins><span>at that time. I am not one of those who favor the unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured. I think it is right that condition</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span> should be attached to that</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> revelation</del><span>.</span>
