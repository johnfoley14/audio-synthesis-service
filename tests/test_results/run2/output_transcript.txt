 It is with
 very great diffidence that I
 rise to address you, both because I
 have only once before addressed your Lord
 house, and because
 of listening to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that other speakers have ten times the political
 knowledge and
 20 times the experience that has
 fallen to my
 Lord, and that it is an
 impertinence for me to say anything at
 all. At the same time, the subject to which I wish to
 confine my remarks,
 namely the atomic bomb and its bearing
 on policy is so
 important and ways so heavily upon my
 mind that I feel all of
 bound to say something about what it means for the
 I should like to begin with just a few
 technical
 points, which I think are familiar to everybody.
 The first is that the atomic bomb is of
 course in its
 infancy and is quite certain very quickly to become both
 much more destructive and very
 much cheaper to produce.
 Both
 those points I think we may...

 namely the synthesizing of hydrogen atoms to make heavier atoms, helium atoms, or perhaps in the first instance night.
 If it can be affected, there will be
 a very much greater release of energy than there is in the disintegration of uranium atoms.
 At
 present, this process has never been observed, but it is
 held
 but it occurs in the sun and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in
 nature at temperatures comparable
 to those you get inside of the sun. The present atomic
 bomb in exploding
 produces temperatures which are thought to be
 about those in the inside of the sun.
 It is therefore possible that
 some mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to
 set off this much more
 violent explosion which would be obtained if one could synthesize.
 All that must take
 place if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not
 bring itself to destruction, all
 that is bound to happen.
 We do not want to look at
 this thing simply from the point of
 view of the next few years. We want to look
 at it from the point of
 view of the future of mankind.
 For
 a scientific society to continue to
 exist, or must such
 a society inevitably bring it.
 It is a simple question, but...
 I do not think it is possible to
 exaggerate the gravity of the
 possibilities of evil that lie in
 the
 utilisation of atomic energy.
 As I go about the streets and
 cease and
 pause the British Museum, the houses of
 Parliament and the other
 monuments of our
 civilisation in my
 mind's eye I see a nightmare
 vision of those
 buildings as heaps of
 rubble with corpses all round them.
 That is a thing we have got to
 face, not only in our own country and
 cities but throughout the civilised
 world as a real probability and less
 the world will agree to find a way of abolishing
 war. It is not
 enough to make war
 rare. Great and serious war has got to be abolished
 because otherwise these things...
 To
 a bullish war is, of course, a very
 difficult problem. I have
 no desire to find fault with those who are trying
 to tackle that problem. I am
 quite sure I could not do anything.
 I simply feel that this is a
 problem that man has got to solve.
 Otherwise, man will drop out, and the planet will perhaps be happy without
 us, although we cannot be expected to share.
 The media difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with
 Russia in dealing with it.
 the Prime Minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as
 code at that time be achieved. I do not suppose he could have done any
 one of those who favor the
 unconditional and immediate revelation to
 Russia of the exact
 processes by which the bomb is manufactured.
