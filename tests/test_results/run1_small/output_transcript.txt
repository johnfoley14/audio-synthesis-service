 My Lords, it is with very great diffidence that I rise to address
 you, both because I have
 only once before addressed your Lordship's House and because of the
 to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that other speakers have ten times the political
 knowledge and twenty times the experience that has fallen to my
 lot. And that it is an impertinence for me to say anything at all. At the same time, the subject to which I wish to confine my remarks, namely the atomic bomb and its bearing on policy, is so important and weighs so heavily upon my mind that I feel
 almost bound to say something about what it means for the future of mankind. I should like to begin with just a few technical points, which I think are familiar to everybody. The first is that the atomic bomb is of course in its
 infancy and is quite certain very quickly to become both much more destructive and very much cheaper to produce. Both those
 points I think we may take a certain then there is another point which was raised by Professor Oliphant and that is that it will not be very difficult to spray a countryside with radioactive products which will kill every living thing throughout a wide
 area not only human beings but every
 insect every sort of thing that lives and there is a further point which perhaps relates to the somewhat more distant future as your Lordships know there are in theory two ways of tapping nuclear energy one is the way which has now been made practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into nuclei of medium weight the other is the way which has not yet been made practicable but which I think will be in time namely the synthesizing of hydrogen atoms to make heavier atoms helium atoms or perhaps in the first instance nitrogen atoms. In the course of that synthesis if it can be affected there will be a very much greater release of energy than there is in disintegration. of uranium atoms. At present this process has never been observed but it is held that it occurs in the Sun and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in nature at temperatures comparable to those you get inside of the Sun. The present atomic bomb in exploding produces temperatures which have thought to be about those in the inside of the Sun it is therefore possible that some mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to set off this much more violent explosion which would be obtained if one could synthesize heavier elements out of hydrogen.
 We do not want to look at
 this thing simply from the point of
 view of the next few years.
 We want to look at it from the
 point of view of the future of mankind.
 The question is a simple one.
 Is it possible for a
 scientific society to continue to
 exist, or must such a society inevitably
 bring itself to destruction?
 It is a simple
 question, but a very viable one.
 I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the
 gravity of the possibilities of
 evil that lie in the
 utilisation of atomic energy. As I go about the streets and
 see St Paul's, the British Museum,
 the Houses of
 Parliament and the other monuments of our civilisation, in my mind's
 eye I see a
 a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of
 rubble, with corpses all round them. That is a thing we have got to face, not only in our own country and cities, but throughout the civilised
 world as a real probability, unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war rare. Great and serious war has got to be abolished, because otherwise these things will happen.
 happen. To abolish war is of course a very difficult problem. I have no desire to find fault with those who are trying to tackle that problem. I am quite sure I could not do any better. I simply feel that this is a
 problem that man has got to solve. Otherwise man will drop
 out and the planet will perhaps be happier without us although we
 cannot be expected to share that view. I think we have got to find a way of dealing with this. As everybody is
 aware, the immediate difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with Russia in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as code as...
