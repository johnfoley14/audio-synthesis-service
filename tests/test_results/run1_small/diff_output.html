<span>My </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">l</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">L</ins><span>ords, it is with very great diffidence that I rise to address </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>you, both because I</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">'</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> ha</ins><span>ve </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>only once before addressed your </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">l</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">L</ins><span>ordship</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">h</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">H</ins><span>ouse and because </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">after listening</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">of the </ins><span> to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that other speakers have ten times the political </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>knowledge and twenty times the experience that has fallen to my </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>lot</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, a</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. A</ins><span>nd that it is an impertinence for me to say anything at all. At the same time, the subject to which I wish to confine my remarks, namely the atomic bomb and its bearing on policy, is so important and weighs so heavily upon my mind</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> that I feel </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>almost bound to say something about what it means for the future of mankind. I should like to begin with just a few technical points, which I think are familiar to everybody. The first is that the atomic bomb is of course in its </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>infancy and is quite certain very quickly to become both much more destructive and very much cheaper to produce. Both those </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>points</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> I think we may take a certain</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. T</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> t</ins><span>hen there is another point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which was raised by Professor Oliphant</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> and that is that it will not be very difficult to spray a countryside with radioactive products</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which will kill every living thing throughout a wide </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>area</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> not only human beings</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> but every </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>insect</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> every sort of thing that lives</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. A</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> a</ins><span>nd there is a further point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which perhaps relates to the somewhat more distant future</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. A</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> a</ins><span>s your Lordships know</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> there are in theory two ways of tapping nuclear energy</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. O</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> o</ins><span>ne is the way which has now been made practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into nuclei of medium weight</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. T</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> t</ins><span>he other is the way which has not yet been made practicable but which I think will be in time</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> n</ins><span>amely the synthesizing of hydrogen atoms to make heavier atoms</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> helium atoms or perhaps in the first instance nitrogen atoms. In the course of that synthesis</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> if it can be affected</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> there will be a very much greater release of energy th</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">a</ins><span>n there is in </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">the </del><span>disintegration</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">.</ins><span> of uranium atoms. At present this process has never been observed but it is held that it occurs in the </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">S</ins><span>un and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in nature at temperatures comparable to those you get inside of the </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">S</ins><span>un. The present atomic bomb in exploding produces temperatures which </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">ar</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">hav</ins><span>e thought to be about those in the inside of the </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">s</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">S</ins><span>un</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. I</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> i</ins><span>t is therefore possible that some mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to set off this much more violent explosion which would be obtained if one could synthesize heavier elements out of hydrogen. </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">All that must take place if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not bring itself to destruction all that is bound to happen.</del><span> We do not want to look at </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>this thing simply from the point of </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>view of the next few years</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, w</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">.  W</ins><span>e want to look at it from the </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>point of view of the future of mankind.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> The question is a simple one.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> Is it possible for a </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>scientific society to continue to </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>exist</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> or must such a society inevitably </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>bring itself to destruction</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">.</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">? </ins><span> It is a simple </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>question, but a very vi</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">tal</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">able</ins><span> one.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>gravity of the possibilities of </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>evil that lie in the </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>utili</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">z</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span>ation of atomic energy. As </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I</ins><span> go about the streets and </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>see St</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">.</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>Paul</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s, the British Museum,</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> the Houses of </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>Parliament and the other monuments of our civilisation, in my mind</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>eye I see a </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> a </ins><span>nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>rubble</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> with corpses all round them. That is a thing we have got to face</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>ot only in our own count</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">r</ins><span>y and cities, but throughout the civili</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">z</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span>ed </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>world as a real probability</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war rare. Great and serious war has got to be abolished</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> because otherwise these things will happen.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">  happen.</ins><span> To abolish war is of course a very difficult problem. I have no desire to find fault with those who are trying to tackle that problem. I am qui</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><span>t</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span> sure I could not do any better. I simply feel that this is a </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>problem that man has got to solve</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> o</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. O</ins><span>therwise man will drop </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>out and the planet will perhaps be happier without us</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> although we </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>cannot be expected to share that view. I think we have got to find a way of dealing with this. As everybody is </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>aware, the immediate difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with Russia in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as co</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">uld at that time be achievd. I do not suppose he could have done any better at that time. I am not one of those who favor the unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured. I think it is right that condition should be attached to that revelation</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">de as..</ins><span>.</span>
