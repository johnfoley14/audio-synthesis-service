 It is with very
 great diffidence that I rise to a dress.
 I've only once before addressed your
 lordship's house, and because, after listening to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that other speakers have ten times the political knowledge and twenty times the experience that has fallen to my lot.
 And that it is an
 impertinence for me to say anything at all, at the same
 time, the subject to which
 I wish to confine my
 remarks, namely the atomic bomb
 its bearing on policy is so important and way so
 heavily upon my mind that I feel
 and twenty times the experience that has fallen to my
 lot, and that it is an
 The atomic bomb is of course in its infancy and is quite certain very quickly to become both much more
 destructive and very much cheaper to produce.
 Both those
 points, I think we may take
 a
 certain then there is another point which was
 raised by Professor
 Oliphant and that is that it will not be
 very difficult to spray a
 countryside with
 radioactive
 products which will kill every living
 thing throughout a wide area, not only human
 beings but every
 insect, every sort of thing that
 lives and there is a further
 point which perhaps
 relates to the somewhat more distant future as your lordships
 know there are in
 theory two ways of tapping.
 One is the way, which
 has now been made
 practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into new
 The other is the way which
 has not yet been made practicable,
 but which I think will be in
 time. Namely, the
 synthesising of
 hydrogen atoms to make
 heavier atoms, helium
 atoms, or perhaps in the
 first instance
 nitrogen atoms.
 In the course of that synthesis, if it can be
 affected, there will be a
 very much greater release of
 energy than there is in the
 disintegration of
 uranium atoms. At present, this process has never been observed, but it is held that it occurs in the sun and in the interior of other stars.
 It only occurs in nature at
 temperatures comparable to those you
 get inside of the sun. The
 present atomic bomb in exploding produces
 temperatures which are thought to be about
 those in the inside of the sun. It is therefore
 possible that some mechanism analogous to the present atomic
 bomb could be used to
 set off this much more violent
 explosion which would be
 obtained if one could
 synthesize heavier elements out of hydrogen.
 Let's take place. If our scientific civilization go.
 After destruction, all that is bound to happen.
 We do not want to look at
 this thing simply from the point of view of
 the next few years. We want to look at
 it from the point of view of the
 future of mankind.
 The
 question is a simple one. Is
 it simple for a scientific
 society to continue to
 exist
 or must such a
 society inevitably bring itself.
 It is a simple question.
 I do not think it is possible to
 exaggerate the gravity of the
 possibilities of evil that
 lie in the utilisation.
 The
 In my mind's eye, I see a nightmare vision of those
 buildings as heaps of
 rubble, with corpses all round.
 That is a thing we have got to
 face, not only in our own
 country and cities, but throughout
 the civilised world as a
 real
 probability, unless the world will
 agree to find a way of
 of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war ran. Great and serious war
 has got to be
 abolished, because otherwise these things will happen.
 To abolish war is of course a
 very difficult problem.
 I have no desire to
 find fault with those who are trying to tackle that
 problem, I am quite sure I could not do
 any better. I simply feel
 that this is a problem that man has got to
 solve. Otherwise, man will
 drop out, and the planet will perhaps be happy without us.
 I think we have got to find a way of
 dealing with
 this. As everybody is aware, the immediate
 difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with
 Russia in dealing with it.
 I think that what the Prime
 Minister achieved in
 Washington was probably as much as
 could at that time be achieved. I do
 not suppose he could have done any
 better at that time. I am not one of
 those who favor the
 unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia at the
 exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured.
 I think it is right that conditions.
