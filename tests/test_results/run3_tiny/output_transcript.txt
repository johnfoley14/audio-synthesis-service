 My
 lord, it is with very great diffidence that I rise to address you, both because
 I have only once before addressed your lord ship's house, and because of listening to the debate yesterday and today, I feel that
 other speakers have
 10 times the political knowledge and 20 times the
 experience that has fallen to
 my
 lot, and that it is an impertinence for me to say
 anything at
 all. At the same time, the subject to which I wish to confine my remarks,
 namely the atomic bomb and its
 bearing on policy is so
 important and
 ways so heavily upon my mind that I feel all of
 bound to say something about what it means for this
 I should like to begin with just a
 few technical points, which I think
 are familiar to everybody.
 The first is that the atomic bomb is
 of course in its
 infancy and is quite certain very quickly to become both much more destructive and very
 much cheaper to produce.
 Both those
 points I think we may take a certain then there was another point which was raised
 by Professor Olafant and that
 is that it will not be very
 difficult to spray a
 countryside with radioactive
 products which will kill every living thing throughout a
 wide area, not only human
 beings but every insect, every sort of thing that lives. And there
 is a further point which perhaps relates to the somewhat
 more distant future, as your lordships know, there are in theory two ways of tapping
 nuclear energy. One is the way which has now been
 made practicable by
 breaking up a heavy nucleus
 into nuclei of medium weight.
 The other is
 the way which has not yet been made
 practicable but which I
 think will be in
 time, namely the synthesising of hydrogen
 atoms to make heavier
 atoms, helium atoms or perhaps in the first
 instance, nitrogen atoms. In the course of
 that synthesis, if it can be affected, there will be a very much greater release of energy than there is in the
 disintegration of uranium atoms.
 The present, this process has never
 been observed but it is
 held that it occurs in the
 sun and in the interior of other stars.
 It only occurs in
 nature at temperatures comparable to
 those you get inside of the sun.
 The present atomic bomb in
 exploding produces temperatures which are thought to be
 about those in the inside of the sun. It is therefore
 possible that some
 mechanism analogous to the
 present atomic
 bomb could be used to set off
 this much more violent explosion which would be
 obtained if one could synthesize. .
 All that must take place.
 if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not bring
 itself to destruction, all that is
 bound to happen.
 We do not want to look at this
 thing simply from the point of view of the
 next few
 years. We want to look at it from the point of view of the future of mankind.
 The question is a simple one.
 Is it
 possible for a scientific
 society to continue to exist?
 Or must such a
 society inevitably bring it?
 It is a simple
 question, but a very vital one.
 I do not think it is possible to
 exaggerate the gravity of the
 possibilities of evil that
 lie in the utilisation.
 I'd like all about the streets and
 seats in Paul's, the British
 Museum, the houses of
 Parliament, and the other monuments of our civilization. In my
 mind's eye, I see a nightmare
 vision of those
 buildings as heaps of
 rubble with corpses all round them.
 That is a
 thing we have got to
 face, not only in our
 own country and
 cities, but throughout the
 civilized world as a real
 probability, unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing
 war. It is not enough to make war
 rare. Great and serious war has got to be
 abolished, because otherwise these things...
 To
 abolish war is of course a very difficult problem.
 I have no desire to find fault with
 those who are trying to tackle that problem.
 I am quite sure I could not do anything.
 I simply feel that this is a problem that man has got to solve. Otherwise, man it will drop out.
 and the planet will perhaps be happy without
 us, although we cannot be expected to share that.
 I think that what the
 prime minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as code at that
 time be achieved. I do not suppose he could have done any
 better at that time.
 I am not one of
 those who
 favor the unconditional and immediate revelation to
 Russia, of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured.
 I think it is
 right that conditions should be be attached to them.
