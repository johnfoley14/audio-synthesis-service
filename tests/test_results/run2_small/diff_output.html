<del style="background:#ffe6e6;">My l</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">Hello  L</ins><span>ords, it is with very great diffidence that I rise to address you, both because I</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">'</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> ha</ins><span>ve only once before addressed your </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">l</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">L</ins><span>ordship</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">h</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">H</ins><span>ouse and because </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">after</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">of the</ins><span> listening to the debate yesterday and </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>today, I feel that other speakers </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>have ten times the political knowledge </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>and twenty times the experience that has fallen to my lot</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. </ins><span> and that it is an imper</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">i</ins><span>tinence for me to say anything at all. At the same time</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> the subject to which I wish to confine my remarks</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> namely the atomic bomb and its bearing on policy</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> is so important and weighs so heavily upon my mind</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> that I feel almost bound</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> to say something about what it means for the future of mankind</del><span>.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> I should like to begin with just a few </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>technical </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>points, which I think are familiar to everybody.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> The </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>first is that the atomic bomb is of course in its </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>infancy and is quite certain </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>very quickly to become both much more </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>destructive and very much </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">chea</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> kee</ins><span>per to produce. Both those points, I think we may take a </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>certain</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. T</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, t</ins><span>hen </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>there is another point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which was raised by </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">Professor Oliphant, and that is that</del><span> it will not be very difficult to spray a countryside with radioactive products</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which will kill every living </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>thing throughout a wide area, not only human </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>beings</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> but every insect</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> and</ins><span> every sort of thing that </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>lives. And there is a further point</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> which perhaps </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">relaxes.  </ins><span>relates to the somewhat more distant future. As your Lordships know, there are in theory two ways of tapping nuclear energy. One is the way which has now been made practicable by breaking up a heavy nucleus into nuclei of medium weight. The other is the way which has not yet been made practicable</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> but which I think will be in time</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>amely the synthesi</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">z</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span>ing of hydrogen atoms to make heavier atoms, helium atoms</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> or perhaps in the first </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>instance</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> nitrogen atoms. In the course of that synthesis, if it can be affected, there will be </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>a very much greater release of energy th</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">a</ins><span>n there is in the disintegration of uranium atoms. At present</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> this process has never been observed</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> but it is </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>held that it occurs in the sun and in the interior of other stars. It only occurs in nature</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> at temperatures </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>comparable to those you get inside of the sun.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> The present atomic bomb </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>in exploding produces temperatures which are thought to be about those in the inside of the </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>sun. It </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">is therefore</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">eventful</ins><span> possible that some mechanism analogous to the present atomic bomb could be used to set off </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>this much more violent explosion</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> which would </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>be obtained if one could </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>synthesize heavier elements out of hydrogen. All that must take place if our scientific civilization goes on. If it does not bring itself to destruction</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> all that is bound to happen.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">  them.</ins><span> We do not want to look at this thing simply from the point of view of the next few years</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">, w</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. W</ins><span>e want to look at it from the point of view of the future of mankind. The question is a simple one.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> Is it possible for a scientific </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>society to continue to exist</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> o</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">? O</ins><span>r must such a society inevitably bring itself to destruction</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">.</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">?</ins><span> It is a simple question,</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> but a very vi</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">tal</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">able</ins><span> one. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> t</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. T</ins><span>he </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>gravity of the possibilities of evil that lie in the </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>utili</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">z</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span>ation of atomic energy. As </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">i</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">I</ins><span> go about the streets and see St</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">.</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>Paul</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s, the British Museum, the Houses of Parliament</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> and the other monuments of our civilisation, in my mind</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">'</ins><span>s eye I see a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of rubble with corpses all round them. That is a thing we have got to face</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">. N</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">, n</ins><span>ot only in our own count</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">r</ins><span>y and cities, but throughout the </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>civili</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">z</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">s</ins><span>ed world</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> a</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. A</ins><span>s a real probability</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> unless the </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war rare.</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span> Great and serious war has got to be abolished</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">,</ins><span> because otherwise these things</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> will happen.</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">... </ins><span> To abolish war is of </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>course a very difficult problem. I have no desire to find fault with those who are trying to tackle that problem. I am qui</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">e</del><span>t</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span> sure I could not do </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>any better. I simply feel that this is a </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>problem that man has got to </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> </ins><span>solve otherwise man will drop out and the planet will perhaps be happier without us</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> although we cannot be expected to share that view. I think we have got to find a way of dealing with this. As everybody is aware</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">,</del><span> the immediate difficulty is to find a way of cooperating with Russia in dealing with it. I think that what the Prime Minister achieved in Washington was probably as much as could at that time be achiev</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">e</ins><span>d. I do not suppose he </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">could. I </ins><span>could have done any better at that time. I am not one of those who favor the </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">unconditional and immediate revelation to Russia of the exact processes by which the bomb is manufactured. I think it is right that condition should be attached to that revelation</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">ongoing. I am not one</ins><span>.</span>
